[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is free and open-source software for statistical computing and graphics. Learning how to use R requires effort, but pays accordingly. This quick guide to R on Mac OS X collects some essential information on how to get started and build your first R extension.

## 1. How to install and use R

### 1.1 Install R
Download and install the latest version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).

After opening R you may run into [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9689104/installing-r-on-mac-warning-messages-setting-lc-ctype-failed-using-c) error message. As a remedy go to your Mac’s Terminal and enter:

    defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8

### 1.2 Use an editor
You can use R’s own console, but you won’t regret something more fancy.

#### 1.2.1 RStudio
It is probably most convenient to use the free and open source [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) IDE for R. Just [download](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), install, and use it.

#### 1.2.2 Sublime Text
If Sublime Text is your favorite editor, here’s how you can set it up. First install [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), if you haven’t done so already, and install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation), a package manager for Sublime Text.

Open Sublime and hit CMD-Shift-P, type _install_, and choose ‘Package Control: Install Package’. Search for ‘R-Box’ and install it. Repeat this step for ‘R-snippets’ and ‘SublimeREPL’. You can now start an R session in Sublime by going to Tools > SublimeREPL > R.

Finally you need to make sure that any R syntax you run from within Sublime is sent to the R session in Sublime: hit CMD-Shift-P again, type _rbox_, and choose ‘R-Box: Choose Program’. Select ‘SublimeREPL’. Now simply hit CMD-Enter on a line of R code to send it to the Sublime R session.

## 2. How to build an R package

### 2.1 Set up
Source the functions that should be included in your package. It is good practice to write each function in a separate file and give the file and function the same appropriate name. To source the functions, either open the files in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) and source them using the source-button, or use the `source()` function.

Now build the skeleton of your package:

    package.skeleton(list = c("functionNameA", "functionNameB", "functionNameC"), name = "packageName")

Find your package skeleton in a directory named after your package in your current working directory. Use the `getwd()` function if you don not remember what your current working directory is.

### 2.2 Write supporting files
The skeleton includes a _DESCRIPTION_ and _NAMESPACE_ file, and a _man_ (hosting the manuals) and _R_ (hosting the functions) directory. Optionally, you may add a [_data_ directory](http://cran.fhcrc.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Data-in-packages), which you may use to include an .Rdata-file for instance.

First open and update the _DESCRIPTION_ file. This file should be self-explanatory, but instructions and an example can be found [here](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file).

Second open and update the _NAMESPACE_ file. Read the [manual](http://cran.fhcrc.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Package-namespaces) for instructions, and have a look at this [example](http://cran.fhcrc.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#An-example).

Finally make sure you write the manual files. Consider using any of [these](http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/doc/KEYWORDS) keywords in your manual.

As these steps might not be trivial the first time, consider having a look at someone else’s package. [Find](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) a package, download and open the _packageName_versionNumber.tar.gz_ file, and open the package files to see how it should be done.

### 2.3 Build package
You may now build the package. Open the Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run (fill in the right names and omit the stars):

    cd /Users/*...*/*parent_directory_of_package_directory*/  
    R CMD build *packageName*  
    R CMD check *packageName*

Be sure to use the correct directory and name of your package. If necessary solve the encountered problems, which are described in the _00install.out_ file in the _packageName.Rcheck_ directory. Build and check your package until it is ready for use. Your package is called _packageName_versionNumber.tar.gz_.

If you wish to submit your package to CRAN, please refer to the [manual](http://cran.fhcrc.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Submitting-a-package-to-CRAN).
