## A Network Theory of Developmental Intelligence
#### Alexander Savi, 10 July 2018

???

* In the next twelve minutes I will introduce a new formal model for a developmental and idiographic intelligence.
* Let me start with a spoiler.

The wiring of facts and procedures, or knowledge and skills, during development.

???

* We use a network model to conceptualize intelligence as the wiring ...
* These nodes represent knowledge and skills, and the edges their connections.
* Colors / domains
* Filled nodes / correct facts or knowledges / adequacies
* Represents a single person: idiographic

]

???

* But that's not where today's story starts
* If we discuss intelligence, there's one phenomenon that must be addressed
* Reflected in this table, published by Spearman in 1904
* Correlations between different scholastic / cognitive abilities
* You'll see high correlations between languages --&gt; __hierarchy__
* But most important: you should observe is that __all correlations are positive__
* This is a phenomenon that we call the __positive manifold__
* Stress it is __not a spurious finding__, John B. Carroll (former president psychometric society) found it in 461 datasets

]

???

* The most famous explanation is the formative _g_ factor model of general intelligence
* One single factor / common cause that influences all mental tasks, hence their positive correlations
* The question __'what is g'__ remains a mystery as of today
* It's certainly not (only) genes
* As of today, __the most popular model of intelligence__ actually is a factor model
* And we asked ourselves: how does development fit into a theory of intelligence

## "[o]ne of the most intractable problems in evaluating the relationship between education and _g_ is the problem of development and age. As near as we can tell, _g_ theories have failed to provide any account of development across the lifespan."

]

???

* So _g_ theory is not where we should be looking
* Where should we?
* There are __2 important contemporary explanations__ of the positive manifold

]

???

* First is van der Maas' __mutualism model__
* As you can see, this is a __network model__
* __Explain model__

* Two things to notice
* 1. "The __positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions__ between cognitive processes during development"
* 2. __No single underlying _g_ factor__

* ? The processes are not further specified, but assumed to be measurable by tests

&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;"Reciprocal causal relations are well known in the psychological literature. For instance, better short-term memory helps to develop better cognitive strategies, and better strategies make it possible to increase the efficiency of short-term memory. Similar examples are the relations between cognition and meta-cognition, between action and perception, and between performance and motivation."&lt;/font&gt;
]

???

* The authors defend their model by explaining the following:

* __Interesting mechanism but simplistic__
* __No clear roles for genes and the environment__: in K factor
* __No actual growth dynamics__ (everything is in there from the start): unclear what drives the actual development / reciprocal relations

???

* The second is Dickens and Flynn's __multiplier effect model__
* They explicitly model genes and the environment (__gene-environment interaction__ model)
* __Explain model__

* __Positive manifold emerges__ from the reciprocal relations of IQ with the environment

* This multiplier effect is a very powerful idea, beautifully described by Stanovich

* ? Self-reinforcement, state-dependence, cumulative advantage, preferential attachment
* ? Explain heritability increase

&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;"The very children who are reading well and who have good vocabularies will read more, learn more word meanings, and hence read even better.

* This mechanism can be generalized:
* The children who are reading well __will also receive better education__, __make friends with people__ that also have a higher ability, etc.

* Now let me show you a powerful mechanisms for this multiplier effect, that does not rely on genetical differences.

* This model is known as __Polya's urn__
* Assume the urn represents a person, let's call her Ann
* Then the balls represent her cognitive abilities: blue for cognitive abilities and yellow for cognitive disabilities
* Now we use one very simple growth mechanism: pick a random ball and put 2 of the same color back

* Another way of looking at this is that: 
* The urn is Ann's IQ, which is at timepoint 0 fully determined by her __genetic endowment__
* The growth mechanism is the __environment__

* Let's take an example:
* E.g., table tennis example backhand versus forehand

* Now do this in a network framework, let's see if it works live
* Balls of the same color get connected
* We start with an initial network, and at each trial we add a node to it
* We attach it to a random node in the network and give it the color of that node

* As you can see the proportion of blue balls, or cognitive ability as we called it, starts to vary greatly

* If we observe many copies of Ann on the long run, this is what we see
* __Explain figure__
* p(blue) is our measure of cognitive ability

* What we see is also called the __Matthew effect__: poor get poorer and rich get richer
* Widening gap (increasing achievement gap)
* Observed in many complex systems: citations, internet, ..., and also in IQ

* Polya works with __identical genetic endowment__

* For the moment, we have only consider the influence of the environment on IQ
* If we would model the full multiplier effect: the urn rule would dependent on what's in the urn
* Even stronger effect!

* But, Matthew effect is not undisputed!
* A closing gap (decreasing achievement gap), called the compensation effect, is also observed

* To obtain this, I gave all Anns formal education
* Rather than adding two balls, I added three balls with p=.5

* __Let me pause for a moment__
* Our simple toy model of a multiplier effect just explained __two of the most important phenomena in the development of intelligence__ (Matthew and compensation effect)
* These phenomena were previously unexplained
* We know that this type of mechanism can explain the positive manifold

???

* This is what we're working on

* Each person is described as a network
* Nodes are on the level of items

* Intelligence is hierarchical, clusters may represent that
* And we want both growth and decay
* __Preferential attachment__ is a multiplier-like mechanism for networks
* But may also include forgetting, by removing nodes or edges

* __Show wiring cognition 2.0 alpha__

* Model we use is the Fortuin Kasteleyn model
* Describes the distribution of the nodes and edges (__omega__)
* Gives us a random network, nodes and edges are allowed to differ across individuals
* Satisfies our requirement of idiography

* The beauty of the model is that it, by definition, satisfies the positive manifold

* ? θ is a parameter of the model that describes the probability that any two skills become connected
* ? δ(a, b) is known as Kronecker’s delta (1 if a=b) (0 if a!=b)
* ? Erdos-Renyi versus Fortuyn-Kastelein: random versus preference for clusters (among other things)

* To get the hierarchical structure, we add communities of nodes
* Within-community connections have a higher probability than between-community connections
