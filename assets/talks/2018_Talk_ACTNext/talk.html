## A Network Theory of Developmental Intelligence
#### Alexander Savi, 8 March 2018

???

* Welcome everyone
* Grateful for getting the opportunity to visit ACT for 2 weeks
* I enjoyed it very much, and met some terrific people
* Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak about this project
* I should start with a disclaimer, it's not a technical talk
* Although the models behind the ideas I discuss are

Formal models for developmental intelligence

* For those of you wondering where The Netherlands is
* Can't see it on the map, because it's fully covered by the bullet

* Before I go into developmental intelligence, I'd like to take the opportunity to quickly introduce a project that Benjamin Deonovic, here from ACTNext, collaborates on
* And which might be of interest to some of you

* Explain Math Garden
* Show error
* In education, we'd like to know the cause of the error, or the misconception
* Ask audience for possible causes
* The exact cause is not so easily determined

* Marthe Straatemeier, current CEO, classified 21 error categories
* In the cells you see the proportion of overlap between categories
* This shows the difficulty of finding the misconception of a student

* If you're able to record enough errors, in a period that you can assume that a student is not learning, ...
* ... those errors can be used to calculate probability estimates for the misconceptions

* Here's some the data from Math Garden
* Notice the number of recorded errors over a short period of time
* Gunter created a model to get probability estimates from such errors

* Hoped to be able to show some preliminary results
* Unfortunately we haven't been able to get the model fully under our control yet

???

* The talk that was advertized is about intelligence, and specifically, a network approach to developmental intelligence

* If we discuss intelligence, there's one main finding that must be addressed
* Reflected in this table, published by Spearman in 1904
* Correlations between different scholastic / cognitive abilities
* You'll see high correlations between languages --&gt; __hierarchy__
* But most important: you should observe is that __all correlations are positive__
* This is a phenomenon that we call the __positive manifold__
* Stress it is __not a spurious finding__, John B. Carroll (former president psychometric society) found it in 461 datasets

]

???

* The most famous explanation is the formative _g_ factor model of general intelligence
* One single factor / common cause that influences all mental tasks, hence their positive correlations
* The question __'what is g'__ remains a mystery as of today
* It's certainly not (only) genes
* As of today, __the most popular model of intelligence__ actually is a factor model
* And we asked ourselves: how does development fit into a theory of intelligence

---
class: center, middle

## "[o]ne of the most intractable problems in evaluating the relationship between education and _g_ is the problem of development and age. As near as we can tell, _g_ theories have failed to provide any account of development across the lifespan."

* So _g_ theory is not where we should be looking
* Where might we look?
* There are __2 important contemporary explanations__ of the positive manifold

]

???

* First is van der Maas' __mutualism model__
* As you can see, this is a __network model__
* __Explain model__

* Two things to notice
* 1. "The __positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions__ between cognitive processes during development"
* 2. __No single underlying _g_ factor__

* ? The processes are not further specified, but assumed to be measurable by tests

&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;"Reciprocal causal relations are well known in the psychological literature. For instance, better short-term memory helps to develop better cognitive strategies, and better strategies make it possible to increase the efficiency of short-term memory. Similar examples are the relations between cognition and meta-cognition, between action and perception, and between performance and motivation."&lt;/font&gt;
]

???

* The authors defend their model by explaining the following:

* An __interisting mechanism but simplistic__
* For one, __no explicit roles for genes and the environment__
* And __no actual growth dynamics__ (everything is in there from the start)

* The second is Dickens and Flynn's __multiplier effect model__
* They explicitly model genes and the environment (__gene-environment interaction__ model)
* __Explain model__

* __Positive manifold emerges__ from the reciprocal relations of IQ with the environment

* This multiplier effect is a very powerful idea, beautifully described by Stanovich

* ? Explain heritability increase

* This mechanism can be generalized:
* The children who are reading well __will also receive better education__, __make friends with people__ that also have a higher ability, etc.

* Yet again, __no actual growth mechanism__

* Now let me take you to __our first step in building a network approach__
* We will __use the multiplier effect to grow a network__
* Let me __explain this through an urn example__

???

* This model is known as __Polya's urn__
* Assume the urn represents a person, let's call her Ann
* Then the balls represent her cognitive abilities: blue for cognitive abilities and yellow for cognitive disabilities
* Now we use one very simple growth mechanism: pick a random ball and put 2 of the same color back

* Another way of looking at this is that: 
* The urn is Ann's IQ, which is at timepoint 0 fully determined by her __genetic endowment__
* The growth mechanism is the __environment__

* Let's take an example:
* E.g., table tennis example backhand versus forehand

* Now do this in a network framework, let's see if it works live
* Balls of the same color get connected
* We start with an initial network, and at each trial we add a node to it
* We attach it to a random node in the network and give it the color of that node

* As you can see the proportion of blue balls, or cognitive ability as we called it, starts to vary greatly

???

* If we observe many copies of Ann on the long run, this is what we see
* __Explain figure__
* p(blue) is our measure of cognitive ability

* What we see is also called the __Matthew effect__: poor get poorer and rich get richer
* Widening gap (increasing achievement gap)
* Observed in many complex systems: citations, internet, ..., and also in IQ

* Polya works with __identical genetic endowment__

* For the moment, we have only consider the influence of the environment on IQ
* If we would model the full multiplier effect: the urn rule would dependent on what's in the urn
* Even stronger effect!

* But, Matthew effect is not undisputed!
* A closing gap (decreasing achievement gap), called the compensation effect, is also observed

---
class: center, middle

&lt;img src="images/compensation.png" style="height: 500px;"/&gt;

???

* To obtain this, I gave all Anns formal education
* Rather than adding two balls, I added three balls with p=.5

* __Let me pause for a moment__
* Our simple toy model of a multiplier effect just explained __two of the most important phenomena in the development of intelligence__ (Matthew and compensation effect)
* These phenomena were previously unexplained
* We know that this type of mechanism can explain the positive manifold

* This is what we're working on

* Each person is described as a network
* Nodes are on the level of items

* Intelligence is hierarchical, clusters may represent that
* And we want both growth and decay
* __Preferential attachment__ is a multiplier-like mechanism for networks
* But may also include forgetting, by removing nodes or edges

???

* Model we use is the Fortuin Kasteleyn model
* Describes the distribution of the nodes and edges
* Gives us a random network, nodes and edges are allowed to differ across individuals
* Satisfies our requirement of idiography

* The beauty of the model is that it, by definition, satisfies the positive manifold

* ? θ is a parameter of the model that describes the probability that any two skills become connected
* ? δ(a, b) is known as Kronecker’s delta (1 if a=b) (0 if a!=b)

## How intelligence gets wired

???

* Through education! (among others)
* The painting you're looking at is the [School of Athens](http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/stanze-di-raffaello/stanza-della-segnatura/scuola-di-atene.html), where you can see philosophers like Plato teach their pupils

&lt;img src="images/edge_sampling.png" style="height: 300px;"/&gt;

⚔ Cognitive growth

* Forgetting / cognitive decline

* Matthew / compensation effects

* Individualization / stratification

???

* We conceptualize it as the sampling of edges
* We might sample an edge with two nodes that haven't been observed before
* At that point the nodes become observed, and the edge is either accepted or not accepted
* Just as in real life (one might get the instruction, or one might not)

* We now have cognitive growth
* And it gives us a tool to study forgetting (microscopic mechanisms in a macroscopic theory)
* ... incorporate Matthew effects
* ... study individualization and stratification (vary how edges are sampled)
